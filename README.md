- 👋 Hi, I’m @newshahn.
  I'm a coder, a cat lover and a movie buff.
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end developement and related technologies. I've been using Angular framework for about a year now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tailwindcss, architectural patterns, and more Angular.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front-end projects. Specifically, if you need some css or scss, I'm your gal.
